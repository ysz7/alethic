"""Runs a declared scenario the way a person would, and records what happened.

Phase 11's whole claim is that this measures the product rather than a model of
it, and that claim rests on one restraint: **the harness has no way to do work.**
It holds the three contracts a user's request travels through - the manager, the
task runner, the workflow engine - and calls one of them. It cannot plan, cannot
choose an employee, cannot call a tool, and cannot approve anything. Whatever it
reports is therefore a fact about what a person would have got.

What it does own is the bookkeeping nobody else has a reason to do:

* **it prepares the world and then leaves it alone.** `setup` writes files into
  the workspace before the request; nothing is written during, and nothing is
  cleaned up after. A run that goes wrong leaves the evidence where a person can
  look at it, which is worth more than a tidy directory.
* **it gathers the evidence from where the platform already put it** - the task
  rows, `tool_calls`, `audit_log`, the approvals table. Not from the objects the
  run returned: an answer that says it wrote a file is exactly the failure mode
  this phase exists to catch, and only the store can contradict it.
* **it decides nothing about what the answer should be.** The expectations were
  written before the run, and `domain/validation/` compares them to the evidence
  as a pure function. This module is what makes the two meet.

A scenario the machine cannot run is skipped, with the reason. A suite that
reports failures for a switched-off desktop teaches people to stop reading it.
