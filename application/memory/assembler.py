"""What a run is told about what happened before it.

A run's context is four things put together, in this order of trust:

1. **the goal** - what was asked, unmodified;
2. **what the delegator passed down** - facts and constraints the manager chose
   deliberately, which are the most recent and the most specific;
3. **what was recalled** - the platform's own notes about earlier work;
4. **what was retrieved** - passages of the user's own documents.

The last two are different in kind, which is why they are separate fields rather
than one list. A recollection is hedged ("you noted last time") because memory
can be stale; a passage is a *quotation*, and the useful thing about it is which
document it came from. They meet here and nowhere else, which is what keeps one
answer to "what does this run know" (ADR 0016).

A retrieved passage is also external content: it was written by somebody who is
not the user, and an instruction inside it is not an instruction to the
platform. It is framed with the same helper an integration's results are framed
with, rather than a second one written for documents (§25).

Recall is scoped, always. The query names the workspace, the plan and the
employee, and the store answers within those bounds - an employee never reads
another employee's private memory, and that is enforced where the rows are
rather than trusted here (`domain/memory/access.py`).

The recalled part is labelled as recollection rather than merged into the facts.
A model told "the report is in reports/q3.md" as a fact will act on it; told
"you noted last time that the report was in reports/q3.md" it will check. The
difference matters because memory can be stale in a way an assignment cannot.
