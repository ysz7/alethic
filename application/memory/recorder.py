"""What is written down, and what is deliberately not.

Memory is expensive in the only currency a run has: every remembered line is a
line of context a later run pays for reading. So this writes four things, each
answering a question a later run actually asks.

* **What happened to a task** (EPISODIC, workspace) - what is now true, and the
  goal it came out of. What the employee *said* is not what is stored: it is put
  through `OutcomeDistiller` first, because a model's closing message is written
  for the person who asked and reads as narration a month later. A failure is
  worth as much as a success here and is kept at a lower importance: knowing
  that an approach did not work is what stops it being tried a third time.
* **What the plan learned** (EPISODIC, plan) - the same outcome, scoped to the
  plan, so the task that follows this one in the same objective reads it while
  an unrelated objective next week does not.
* **What this employee learned** (SEMANTIC, private) - which interfaces and
  tools actually reached the work. It is private because it is about how *this*
  employee works, and telling another employee would be advice from someone
  else's machine.
* **How the user wants things done** (SEMANTIC, user) - the standing
  preferences Prometheus read out of a request, and *only* those. These are the
  memories with no expiry, because a preference does not stop being true on a
  timer - which is exactly why what goes in here has to be a preference. A
  request's own parameters ("the sales folder", "call it summary.md") look
  identical and are not: kept here, they come back as workspace facts and point
  the next request at the last one's folder. That is not a hypothetical; it is
  what the first validation run did (validation/tasks/phase-09-*).

Two rules hold throughout. **A failure to remember never fails the work**: every
write is guarded, and a run whose memory backend is down is a run that goes
slightly worse, not a run that stops. And **nothing is written that was not
already safe to persist**: the content comes from summaries that have been
through `redact`, and tool *arguments* are never stored - only names.
