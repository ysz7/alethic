"""Keeping memory from growing into noise (§9.7).

Three mechanisms, and they do different jobs:

* **Time to live** removes what was only ever true for a while - the working
  notes of a task that ended hours ago. That is `prune`, and it needs no model.
* **Decay** pushes the old below the recent without deleting it, so a fact from
  March is still there when nothing newer answers the question. That is
  `domain.memory.ranking`, and it needs no model either.
* **Summarisation** is the only one that does. Thirty episodes saying "sorted
  the invoices folder, it worked" are one thing worth knowing, and no amount of
  ranking turns them into it. So when the episodic record passes a threshold,
  the oldest batch is folded into a single semantic item and the originals are
  forgotten.

The threshold is what keeps this affordable: consolidation is not run per task,
it is run when there is enough to consolidate. And it is guarded like every
other memory operation - a summariser that fails leaves the episodes in place,
which is a store that is larger than it should be rather than one that has lost
something.
