"""The manager's half of memory: what this workspace knows, in general.

Prometheus reads and writes at a different grain from an employee. An employee
remembers how a task went; the manager remembers how the user wants things done
here, and hands what it knows down to the tasks it delegates - which is why what
it recalls goes into `SharedContext.facts` rather than into a prompt of its own.
Passing it down means the employee sees it in the one place it already looks,
and the same narrowing rules apply to it as to everything else in an assignment.

This is deliberately a small object over the same `Memory` contract, not a
second store. There is one memory; there are two grains of question asked of it.
