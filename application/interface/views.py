"""Domain values as JSON, in one place.

Kept apart from the routes so the shape the browser sees is defined once and can
be read without reading the server. It is a projection, not a serialization
format: the interface shows what a person needs to judge a run - what it did,
what it cost, what went wrong - and nothing that only the runtime cares about.

It sits in `application/` rather than in one interface's package because the
shape is a property of the platform, not of HTTP: a desktop shell, a page and a
chat bot showing three different summaries of the same run would be three
answers to a question with one answer.

Two omissions are deliberate. The transcript is not exposed: it is the model's
working memory, it is large, and a page that renders it becomes a log viewer,
which is exactly the thing Phase 6 exists to stop the developer reading. And
nothing here reaches into `execution.state`, so the interface does not become a
second consumer of the resume cursor's shape.
