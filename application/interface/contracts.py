"""What an interface hands in, in a form that does not name the interface.

One type crosses the boundary inwards: `UserRequest`. Everything the platform
needs to start work is on it, and nothing about where it came from changes what
happens next - which is the whole point. `source` is recorded, never branched
on. The first `if request.source is RequestSource.DESKTOP:` anywhere below this
file is the moment the core acquires a favourite interface, and every other one
starts being the degraded path.

`input_type` and `attachments` are declared now and mostly unused now. That is
deliberate and it is cheap: they are fields on a frozen dataclass, not
machinery. Voice is the case worth naming - a spoken request becomes a
`UserRequest` with `input_type=VOICE` and text already transcribed by whatever
adapter heard it, so speech never becomes something the core has to know about.
The alternative, adding the field when voice arrives, means changing every
adapter at the moment there is least slack to do it.
