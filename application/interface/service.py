"""One object every interface talks to.

`PrometheusService` is a facade and is written to stay one. It decides nothing: it
does not plan, does not choose an employee, does not call a tool and does not
judge whether an action is allowed. Every method here is a short arrangement of
things that already exist - the manager, the task runner, the repositories, the
approval service - and the moment one of them starts containing a rule, that
rule has been moved out of the core and into the interface layer, which is the
regression this package exists to prevent.

Two consequences worth stating.

**There is one way to start work, and this is not a second one.** A request
becomes an objective through `PrometheusManager`, exactly as `ask-prometheus`, a workflow
step and a schedule firing do. A method here that ran a task itself would be a
second execution engine wearing a convenience name.

**Unknown means None, not an exception.** Asking for a conversation that does
not exist is a normal thing for an interface to do - a stale link, a window
reopened after a database was cleared - and the answer is "there is no such
thing", which every transport can render. Exceptions are kept for what actually
went wrong.
