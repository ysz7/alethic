"""The loop that starts work nobody asked for, right now (§12.9).

It is deliberately the least clever thing in the platform. It wakes up, asks
what is due, and hands each one to the manager exactly as `ask-prometheus` would.
Everything that makes an objective safe - the policies, the approval gate, the
STOP file, the budget - is below this line and is not re-implemented above it.
A scheduler that knew how to run a task would be a second way to run one.

Four decisions, and each rejects a plausible alternative.

**It polls.** Not a timer per schedule, not a heap of wake-up calls: one pass on
a fixed tick that asks the store what is due. A process that is killed loses
nothing, because the answer lives in the row rather than in a timer somebody has
to re-arm; and "due" is then a question a person can also ask, which is what
`prometheus schedules` prints.

**A schedule that is still running does not start again.** The commonest
scheduling failure is a job whose period is shorter than its duration, and the
symptom is not an error - it is a machine getting slower all week. So a firing
is remembered while it is in flight and the next pass skips it, having said so.

**The clock advances before the work, not after.** A schedule is marked fired
the moment it is picked up. Crashing mid-objective then costs that one
objective, and not an endless retry of whatever was expensive enough to crash.

**A failure is an event, not a stop.** One schedule whose objective raised must
not take the loop down with it - the other schedules on this machine have
nothing to do with it. It is logged, recorded, and the pass continues.
