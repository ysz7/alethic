"""The manager's half of knowledge: what this workspace has been given to read.

`WorkspaceMemory` is the same shape one layer over, and the parallel is
deliberate. Prometheus reads at a different grain from an employee: an employee
retrieves against the task it was handed, and the manager retrieves against the
request as the person wrote it - before there is a plan, and before anybody has
been chosen. Without this, a question whose answer is in an uploaded document
gets read as needing no work, answered "I do not have that", and the document is
never reached, because retrieval only happened inside a task nobody started.

Two things follow from where this sits.

**What it returns is quoted, never asserted.** The passages go into
`SharedContext.facts` the way recollections do, but framed as external content
with their source attached (§25, ADR 0016): the manager is passing on somebody
else's words, and an instruction inside a document is not an instruction to the
platform.

**Failure is silence.** Retrieval that cannot answer costs the run its
citations, never the run - the same guarantee memory has, for the same reason:
the request is still worth attempting without it.
