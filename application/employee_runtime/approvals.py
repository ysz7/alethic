"""The brake that comes with the hands.

Phase 4 put one rule on the single path every tool call takes: an action the
user cannot undo does not happen until the user says so. Phase 10 keeps the
position and replaces the rule with a policy engine, which changes three things.

**A denial is not a question.** Risk alone can only ever produce "ask"; a
declared policy can produce "no". A tool this employee is forbidden is refused
without a prompt, because offering the user a chance to allow one call of
something an employee was declared not to do turns the declaration into a
suggestion.

**Waiting is a state of the task, not of the coroutine.** A task parked on a
person is moved to WAITING_FOR_APPROVAL and back, so `alethic tasks` says what a
run is actually doing rather than showing it as RUNNING with nothing happening.

**The refusals are recorded here, and only the refusals.** A denied action and
a declined approval are the two things that leave no trace anywhere else - the
tool never ran, so there is no tool call to account for. What did run is audited
by the executor, and what the user answered is in the approvals table; writing a
second line here for a call that is about to be audited anyway would mean every
approved action appearing twice in the one place people read to count them.

The gate stays between the executor and the tool rather than inside either. In
the executor it would be checked once and forgotten by the next tool; inside
each tool it would be re-implemented per tool, and the one that forgot would be
the one that mattered.
