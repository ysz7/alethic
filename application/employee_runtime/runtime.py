"""One runtime for every employee.

An employee is its declaration plus this loop. There is no researcher class and
there will not be an analyst class: a second runtime would mean the difference
between two employees had stopped being declarative, which is the thing this
design exists to prevent.

The stages are: plan, execute, verify - and verify can send the work back once.
State is written to the task after every stage and after every step inside
execution, which is what lets a killed process pick the task up again.

Memory joins the loop at the two moments it is worth anything: what was learned
before is recalled into the context planning starts from, and what happened is
written down once the task reaches a terminal state. Both are optional
dependencies - a runtime with no memory is the Phase 8 runtime, and a memory
that cannot be reached slows a run down rather than failing it.

One thing the runtime does with an assignment is worth naming: a delegator may
*narrow* what the employee may use for this task, and the runtime applies that
by intersecting it with the declaration. Narrowing works; widening cannot, since
the intersection can only ever shrink. Delegation therefore never escalates
privileges, and that is a property of this code rather than of the manager's
good behaviour.
