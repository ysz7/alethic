"""Running a process somebody already knows the shape of.

Alethic plans an objective it has never seen before. A workflow is the opposite
case - the decomposition is known, was written down, and should not be
rediscovered by a model every Monday. What must *not* differ is everything
below the decomposition: the same employees, the same runtime, the same tool
registry, the same approval gate. So this engine decides nothing about how work
is done; it walks a declared graph and hands each step to `StepExecution`, which
is the contract the manager uses for exactly the same purpose.

Three things are worth stating, and each is a failure mode the design avoids.

**Dependencies are declared edges, resolved before anything runs.** A cycle is
reported as a cycle, not discovered by a run that never terminates - the same
rule Phase 7 applied to plans, for the same reason.

**A step that fails takes the run down by default.** A later step usually reads
what an earlier one produced, and running it anyway produces a confident answer
built on a gap. `on_failure: CONTINUE` is available and is a decision the author
of the workflow makes per step, in the file, where a reader can see it.

**Retries are per step and re-enter the whole step.** The runner already retries
a transient provider failure inside one task; what this adds is the case where
the task itself came back unsuccessful. Whether that is worth repeating depends
on what the step does, which is why the number lives on the step.
