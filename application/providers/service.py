"""Adding a provider, a key and a model, and saying where work goes.

Everything a settings page does, decided here once rather than per surface. The
window, the CLI and anything written later call the same methods, so "a key is
never returned", "a connection nothing points at can be removed and one holding
up a model cannot" and "a default has to name an entry that exists" are
properties of the platform rather than of whichever page got them right.

Four rules, and each of them rejects something that would otherwise be natural.

**A key goes in and never comes back.** `store_credential` writes to the
credential store; nothing here returns a secret, and the views say only whether
one is set. A settings page that can show a key is a settings page that puts one
in a screenshot, a bug report and a log.

**A connection is checked against the adapters before it is stored.** A kind
nothing implements would sit in the window looking configured and fail at the
first call, which is the furthest possible point from the mistake.

**Removing a connection that models point at is refused, and says which.**
Deleting it silently would leave entries that route into an error, and the
person who removed a key they had finished with is the one least able to guess
why planning stopped working.

**A model is added by picking, not by typing, wherever that is possible.** A
local runner is asked what it has; a field where a person types `gemma3:27` is a
field that accepts it and fails four hours later inside a task.
