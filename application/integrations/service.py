"""Connecting a service, and everything that follows from it.

This is the lifecycle, and it decides nothing about how work is done. It adds a
record, starts a server, asks what it offers, puts the result in the registry
every other tool lives in, and takes it away again. What an employee may call,
whether an action needs approval, who does the work: all of that was decided
before this module existed and is not re-decided here.

Three things it must get right, each of which is a way the obvious version goes
wrong.

**A failure is a status, not an exception that escapes.** The person connecting
a server mistypes a command, and the answer they need is "that did not start",
attached to the record, visible next time they open the window. A traceback
reaching the interface would be a stack trace where a sentence belongs.

**Registering and forgetting are the same operation in reverse.** Every name an
integration contributed is removed when it is disabled or removed - so a server
that is gone leaves no tool behind that a model can see and nobody can call.
Names come off the *stored* record rather than off a live connection, because
the connection is exactly what is missing when it matters.

**The registry is not the source of truth.** The database is. The registry is
this process's view of it, and `restore` is how a process that has just started
gets that view - which is also why discovery is not repeated on every boot: what
a server offered is cached on the record, and starting ten subprocesses to
re-learn what is already written down would make every start-up wait for the
slowest one.
