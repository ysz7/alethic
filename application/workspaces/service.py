"""Creating, switching and removing a workspace.

It decides nothing about how work is done. It reads and writes the records, and
tells the process's `WorkspaceContext` what exists so that the filesystem tools
resolve the right root on their next call - the same arrangement as
`refresh_grants`, and for the same reason: a switch is a person-sized event that
has to be true on the very next run rather than after a cache expires.

Three rules are worth stating because the obvious version gets each one wrong.

**Removing a workspace removes the record, not the history.** No foreign key
points at `workspaces` (migration 014), so the tasks, plans, memory and audit
lines belonging to it survive - which is what the audit table has always been
for. Deleting a person's history is a separate act that says so, and the files
on disk are not touched at all: a directory the user put documents in is theirs.

**The first workspace cannot be removed.** Every row written before Phase 15
belongs to it, and it is where a machine falls back to when the active one is
gone. Removing it would orphan the history it holds and leave nowhere to land.

**Removing the active workspace lands on the default one.** The alternative -
leaving the machine pointed at a workspace that no longer exists - would be
discovered by the next request, which is the worst moment to discover it.
