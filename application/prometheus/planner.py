"""Turning one objective into the tasks that will satisfy it.

This is not the employee planner. That one breaks a task into steps for a single
run; this one breaks an objective into *tasks*, each of which will be given to
somebody and executed in full. The unit of decomposition here costs an entire
employee run, which is why the prompt argues for fewer of them and why the
default assumption is one.

Three decisions are worth stating.

**A plan is a value, and replanning makes a new one.** Revisions supersede
rather than overwrite: what Prometheus thought the first time is the only evidence of
why a second attempt was needed, and an edited plan destroys it.

**Dependencies are declared, not implied by order.** A list of tasks in an order
somebody happened to write them in cannot be run in parallel and cannot be
checked for a cycle. Declared edges can be both, which is what makes Phase 12's
concurrency a change of executor rather than a change of plan.

**What a task needs is stated, so the workforce can be searched rather than
read.** Each task carries what whoever takes it must offer - a capability, or
the name of a connected service, because since Phase 18 those are two axes of
the same question and the closed capability vocabulary could not express the
second (`domain/workforce/routing.py`). The
delegator narrows by those before showing anything to a model, which is what
makes a declared capability worth declaring - and what makes a workforce of
thirty a search rather than thirty cards in a prompt. A task that names none is
open to everybody, which is the right default for work that is mostly judgement.

**Decomposition is done knowing what this workspace already knows.** A request
is often written against the last one - "do the same for the returns folder" -
and a planner that cannot see what "the same" was decomposes the wrong thing: it
writes a task to go and find out what happened last time, which spends an
employee run on archaeology and produces a report about a report. That is not a
hypothetical either; it is what this planner did, twice, while the recalled
context reached the employees but not the manager (validation/tasks/phase-09-*).

**A plan that cannot be read is still a plan.** A model that returns prose gets
the objective back as a single task rather than an exception. One task that says
exactly what the user asked for is a worse plan than a good decomposition and a
far better outcome than a run that never started.
