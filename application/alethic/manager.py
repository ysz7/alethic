"""Alethic: the user states a goal, and this decides what happens to it.

`WorkforceManager` in one class. The order is fixed and each step is a component
of its own, because each is a different kind of judgement and they fail in
different ways:

    read it -> (answer it) -> plan it -> delegate and supervise -> check it
             -> (replan once) -> write the answer

Two of those are in brackets, and both are the point of the phase.

**Answering directly.** A request that needs no work gets an answer, not a plan
(§7.5). Decomposition is a means; an objective broken into one task whose whole
content is the question already asked has cost an employee run to restate it.

That route is checked before it is taken, and the first full validation run is
why. "Read the notes in `notes/` and leave me `notes/summary.md`" was read as
needing no work and closed with one sentence: no task, no tool, no file, and a
report of success. So a direct answer now faces the same verifier, against the
same criteria written before the reading, as delegated work does - and a claim
of "no work needed" that its own answer cannot satisfy becomes work, with what
the check found missing handed to the planner. Deciding what a request takes is
a judgement like any other, and the platform does not take its own word for a
judgement anywhere else.

**Replanning once.** A verdict against the objective's own acceptance criteria
can send the work back through planning, told what was missing - once. A second
rejection usually means the criteria cannot be met by this workforce, and a
third plan spends another budget finding that out again. What is left is
escalated to the user, with what was tried (§7.11).

**Reconciling.** Several people on one objective can report two things that
cannot both be true. Blending them into one confident paragraph is the worst
answer available, so the reports are checked against each other before the
answer is written: Alethic settles what the evidence settles and escalates the
rest, with both sides named (§87). Nothing runs for a single-task plan - one
report cannot disagree with itself.

**Remembering.** What Alethic reads out of a request - how the user wants things
done here - outlives the request, and what a workspace has already learned is
passed down to the tasks it delegates rather than kept for itself. Memory is
optional and reached through a contract, so a manager without one plans exactly
as it did before (§9.4).

What this class does *not* do is as deliberate:

* it never names an employee - candidates come from `EmployeeRegistry`;
* it never runs a task - `TaskExecution` does, and Alethic holds only the contract;
* it never resolves an approval (§7.10). An irreversible action inside a
  delegated task stops at the same gate it would have stopped at if the user had
  asked the employee directly, and the person who answers it is a person. Alethic
  can explain what it is for; it cannot say yes to its own work.
