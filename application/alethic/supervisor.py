"""Running a plan, and deciding what a failed task means.

The employee runtime already retries inside a task: a rejected verdict sends the
work back through planning once. This is the layer above, and it answers a
different question - not "should this task try again" but "does the objective
still have a route to done, and what is it".

Three answers, and they are not interchangeable (§7.7):

* **retry** - the same task, the same employee, because the failure was
  transient and the second attempt has as good a chance as the first;
* **reassign** - the same task, somebody else, because the employee could not
  reach what the task needed;
* **replan** - a different decomposition, because the task itself was wrong.

Retrying a task that nobody can do, or reassigning one that failed because the
provider was down, both burn a budget to arrive back where they started. So the
choice is made from the *kind* of failure, by type and by what the run reported,
never by the text of a message - the same rule `application/orchestrator.py`
follows one layer down.

Dependencies are honoured, and a task whose dependency failed is never started:
a summary written from a source that was never fetched is worse than no summary.

Phase 12 adds three things to that, and none of them changes the plan.

**Independent tasks run at once.** `Plan.ready` has always returned every task
whose dependencies are met; the difference is that they are now started
together, up to a limit, instead of one after another. Everything in one wave is
independent by construction - if two tasks needed ordering, the planner would
have written the edge - so this is the executor catching up with what the plan
already said. A limit rather than no limit: each task is a whole employee run
with its own model calls and its own tools, and a plan of six firing at once is
six browsers.

**A failure ends the plan, not the wave.** The tasks already in flight beside a
failing one are allowed to finish and their results are kept. They were never
downstream of it - that is what independent means - and throwing away work that
succeeded because something unrelated did not is a cost with nothing behind it.

**A result is accepted on the evidence.** `domain.workforce.acceptance` reads
what the task actually did off its own record. An employee that reported success
having had every tool call refused has not done the work, and the manager is the
one who has to say so: the employee's own verifier is the same run asked twice.
