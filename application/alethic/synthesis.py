"""One answer, from however many reports it took.

The user asked Alethic, not the team, and has not seen the plan. Handing back a list
of task summaries would make them do the manager's job - reading four reports to
find the one sentence they wanted.

The rule that matters is what synthesis must *not* lose: names, numbers, links
and paths. A summary that drops the specifics is worse than the reports it
replaced, because the reports at least had them. So the prompt says so, and the
fallback below - used when a model call is unavailable or produces nothing -
keeps the reports intact rather than inventing a smoother answer than the
evidence supports.

A shortfall is stated, never smoothed. An objective that came up short and reads
as though it did not is the one failure mode of this component that a user
cannot detect for themselves.
