"""Choosing who does a task, and handing it down without handing down more.

§7.6 is the load-bearing sentence of this phase: *zero mentions of a concrete
employee in Alethic's code.* Candidates come from `EmployeeRegistry` and nowhere
else, so the workforce is a directory of declarations rather than a list in this
file. Delete a declaration and nothing here changes; add one and it is offered
on the next run. `tests/unit/test_alethic_governance.py` enforces that by reading
`employees/` and failing if any of those names appears in this package - prose
included, because a name in a comment is a name that will be in a branch later.

**The field is narrowed by what the work needs, before anybody is asked.** The
plan says what each task requires - a capability, or the name of a connected
service - and `EmployeeRegistry.find_by_capability` and
`domain.workforce.routing.holders` answer who qualifies. The second axis is
Phase 18's: every term in the capability vocabulary is already claimed by
somebody the platform ships with, so an integration could only ever contribute
one that four employees already declare. Narrowing is what makes a declared
capability worth declaring, and what keeps a workforce of thirty a search rather
than thirty cards in a prompt. A narrowing that leaves nobody is discarded
rather than obeyed - a task routed to no one is worse than a task routed
imperfectly, and the requirement was a hint about the work, not a rule about the
workforce.

**One candidate needs no model call.** A workforce of one has nothing to choose
between, and asking a model to pick from a list of one spends money to be told
what was already true. Narrowing often produces exactly that, which is the point:
the only employee that can run code gets the task that needs code, for free.

**A choice the model gets wrong is corrected, not obeyed.** Names are checked
against the registry; an invented one falls back to the ranking below. The model
ranks, it does not authorise.

**Delegation never escalates privileges.** The employee's own declaration is the
only source of what it may use, so Alethic cannot widen it by asking. It can
deliberately *narrow* - `SharedContext.granted_tools` records what the manager
meant to allow - and the runtime intersects that with the declaration, so the
narrowing is real and the widening is impossible. `effective_tools` in
`domain/policies` is exactly that intersection, and this is its caller.
