# Validation

Real work a human actually wanted done, used to close a phase.

A phase is not finished because its tests are green. It is finished when the
capability it added has done a useful piece of work, recorded here.

Phase 1 is the one exception: it builds the foundation and has nothing a user
could ask for yet.

## Two directories, and why they are two

**`tasks/`** is what happened and why - one Markdown report per phase, written
for a person. It is the most useful prose in the repository: three of the rules
in `CLAUDE.md` were defects one of these runs found before they were rules.
What it cannot do is be re-run.

**`scenarios/`** is the request itself, declared so it can be made again. One
YAML file per scenario: what is asked, which of the platform's three doors it
goes through, what the machine must have for the request to mean anything, and
what would count as done - written before the run, so the standard cannot be
adjusted after seeing the output.

Merging the two would give either a report nobody can re-run or a declaration
nobody can read.

**`REPORT.md`** is generated, not written. `alethic validation-report` computes
it from the recorded runs; editing it by hand would turn a measurement back into
an opinion.

## Running them

```bash
alethic scenarios                 # what is declared, and how each has gone here
alethic validate                  # all of them, recording every attempt
alethic validate sort-a-folder    # one
alethic validate --regression     # only what has passed here before (§11.5)
alethic validation-report --write validation/REPORT.md
```

This is not the test suite. `uv run pytest` is free, offline and fast, and says
the platform still does what it was built to do. This costs money and minutes,
and says whether that is worth anything on a request somebody actually made.

Against locally served models it costs nothing:

```bash
export ALETHIC_MODEL_CATALOG_PATH=infrastructure/llm/models.local.toml
```

A run with nobody watching refuses everything that needs approval, and the
report says NEEDED_APPROVAL rather than pretending the capability is absent.
That is the honest reading of an unattended machine; to measure what a person at
the keyboard would get, answer the prompts.

## Adding one

Write a file in `scenarios/`. Nothing else - no Python, no registration.
`tests/e2e/test_validation_harness.py` declares one in a temporary directory and
runs it, which is that claim as a test.
