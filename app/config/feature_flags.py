"""Flags for capabilities that arrive in later phases.

Each one is off until the phase that implements it lands, so a half-built
capability can sit in the tree without being reachable. Once the phase lands,
the flag stays as the switch that turns the capability off on a machine where
it is not wanted - Phase 5's DoD depends on exactly that.
