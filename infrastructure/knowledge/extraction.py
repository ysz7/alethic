"""Turning a file into text, and refusing to guess when it cannot.

The extractors are small and separate because the failure they exist to prevent
is silent: a PDF read as bytes and decoded as UTF-8 produces a page of mojibake
that chunks, embeds and retrieves perfectly well, and answers questions with
nonsense. So a format either has an extractor that understands it or is refused
with a sentence saying which format it is - and refusing is the behaviour that
lets somebody install the missing extra and try again.

**PDF support is an optional extra.** `uv sync --extra documents` brings
`pypdf`; without it a PDF is refused by name rather than read badly. That is the
same rule the browser and desktop extras follow: installing the platform does
not install everything it could ever need.

**Nothing here summarises, truncates or reformats.** What comes out is what the
document said, because everything downstream - the chunker, the index, the
citation in a prompt - is built on the text being the text.
