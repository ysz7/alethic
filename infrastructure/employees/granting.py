"""The employee registry, with integration grants already applied.

A decorator rather than a change to `YamlEmployeeRegistry`, because the two
answer different questions and only one of them is about files. The YAML
registry reads declarations, which is a property of the repository; whether
`gmail` is connected on this machine right now is a property of the machine, and
mixing them would make reading an employee file depend on a database.

So this wraps any `EmployeeRegistry` and hands out the same employees with their
grants expanded (`domain.integrations.grants`). Everything above - Prometheus's
capability search, the delegator, the runtime, the tool registry's own least
privilege check - keeps working on an `EmployeeDefinition` and learns nothing.

**The snapshot is refreshed, not queried.** `EmployeeRegistry.list` is
synchronous and called while a plan is being made; reaching a database from it
would put I/O on that path, and an async version would spread through every
caller for no gain. So the integrations are loaded once at start-up and again
whenever the set actually changes - connecting, enabling, removing - which is a
person-sized event rather than a per-call one.
