"""Talking to an MCP server over its standard input and output.

Written here rather than taken from an SDK, and the reason is the dependency
rather than the protocol: what the platform needs of MCP is three calls -
initialize, list the tools, call one - over newline-delimited JSON-RPC, and that
is less code than the adapter that would wrap a library providing it. When a
second transport is needed the shape below is what it implements.

Two decisions worth knowing before editing this.

**The subprocess is a resource with an owner.** It is started on demand and
closed by whoever started it; nothing here reaps a process it did not spawn, and
`aclose` is safe to call twice, because the common path is a runtime shutting
down after a run that may or may not have reached this server.

**Everything that goes wrong is an `IntegrationError`.** A server that is not
answering, one that answered with something unreadable, one that never started:
each becomes a typed failure whose `transient` flag the orchestrator already
knows how to read. Parsing a message for a reason to retry is what this avoids.
