"""Memory in a SQL database. SQL does not leave this package.

One adapter for both backends. What differs between them is the text search -
FTS5 on SQLite, `tsvector` on PostgreSQL - and that difference is written twice
here rather than abstracted into something that is neither. Two adapters would
have been two things to keep true, and the second one would fall behind
(ADR 0017).

The text search is the only part of the system that knows which index it is.
It is used the way an index should be used - to narrow, not to decide: the index
answers *which items mention this*, and `domain.memory.ranking` answers *which
of those are worth reading now*. Ranking by BM25 alone would return the best
textual match to "the report", which is every report ever written.

The rank from the index is turned into a relevance between 0 and 1 rather than
passed through raw, because the domain multiplies it by importance and decay,
and a score whose scale depends on the backend would make the policy depend on
the backend too.
