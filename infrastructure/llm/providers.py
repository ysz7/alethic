"""Which kinds of provider this machine can talk to, and what each one needs.

The list lives here because this is where the adapters are: `factory.py` maps a
kind to a class, and a kind with no class behind it is a record the user can
create and never use. It is deliberately not in `domain/` - no vendor is named
there, and the architecture test fails the build over it.

`needs_credential` is the only thing a caller above the adapters has to know,
and it exists because of the one kind that does not: a model runner on this
machine has no account behind it, and demanding a key for it would make the one
setup that needs no configuration need some.
