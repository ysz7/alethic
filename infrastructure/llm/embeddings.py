"""Turning text into vectors, over the embeddings wire format.

The same shape as `chat_completions`: several services - a local model runner, a
hosted provider - expose one `POST /embeddings`, so the module is named after
the format rather than after a vendor, and which model answers is the router's
decision like every other model choice (ADR 0003).

Three things it has to get right.

**A batch is one call.** Indexing a document is hundreds of passages, and a call
per passage over a local server is minutes instead of seconds. The order that
comes back is the order that went out, checked rather than assumed: an answer
whose vectors are shuffled would attach every passage to its neighbour's
meaning, which nothing downstream could ever notice.

**The dimension is what came back**, not what the catalog claimed. The catalog
entry says what to expect so that a store can be planned; this reports what was
actually produced, because that is what gets written onto the chunk and what a
later query is compared against.

**A server that is not there is a configuration problem with a clear fix**, and
the error says so - the same rule the local chat provider follows. Retrieval
above catches it and falls back to the text index rather than failing a run.
