"""Turns a routing decision into a client, with metering attached.

This is the one place that maps a provider name to a class. A caller asks the
router for a model and this for a client, and never learns which vendor answered.

**Where the key comes from is a property of the connection, not of the vendor.**
Until Phase 17 there was one `api_key` and one `base_url` for everything, so
"which provider" and "which account" were the same question - and a person with
two keys to one vendor had no way to say so. Now a catalog entry names a
connection, the connection names a credential and an address, and the value is
resolved here, at the moment the client is built, from `SecretResolver`.

An entry naming no connection still works and means what it always meant: the
key and address this machine was configured with. Every entry in the shipped
catalog is one of those, and a machine with a `.env` and no settings page must
not stop working because a table was added.
