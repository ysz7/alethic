"""Credentials in the store, sealed, with a cache that keeps the read side sync.

Two contracts, one class, exactly as `LocalCredentialStore` does it: they are
separate so that holding the reader does not hand a caller the writer, and one
class because both work over the same rows.

**Why there is a cache at all.** `SecretResolver.get` is synchronous, and it is
synchronous for a reason worth keeping: it is called from inside a tool at the
moment of the call, and making it a coroutine would put an `await` on the one
path that must not acquire anything. The store is asynchronous. So the sealed
rows are loaded once by `restore` - the same word integrations use for the same
reason - and held as *ciphertext*: what sits in memory is no more readable than
what sits in the database, and the master key opens one value at a time, at the
moment it is asked for.

The cost is honest and small: a credential written by another process is not
seen until this one restores. That is already true of integrations, and the
alternative is an async read on the hot path of every tool call.

Reading order is unchanged from the file store: the environment wins. A machine
that exports a key should not be overridden by something a settings window wrote
months ago, and a person debugging a credential needs one place they can be sure
of.
