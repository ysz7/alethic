"""Credentials kept on this machine, in a file only this user can read.

What this is, stated plainly so nobody mistakes it for more: a JSON file in the
data directory with mode 0600, and the honest description of that is *not
encrypted at rest*. It protects a credential from other users of the machine
and from anything that copies the project directory; it does not protect it from
this user, from a process running as them, or from a stolen disk.

That is the right size for the first version and it is deliberately behind a
contract. `CredentialStore` is what the platform depends on, so the encrypted
store or the OS keychain that eventually replaces this is a new class in this
package and nothing else - no caller changes, because no caller was ever
allowed to know where a credential lives.

Reading goes through `SecretResolver` as everywhere else, and the environment
wins over the file: a machine that already exports a token should not be
overridden by something a UI wrote months ago, and a user debugging a credential
needs one place they can be sure of.
