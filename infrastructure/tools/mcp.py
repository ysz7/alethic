"""A tool that happens to live in another process.

This is the whole of MCP's contact with the rest of the platform. It subclasses
`BaseTool` like every other tool, so it gets the same argument validation, the
same coercion, the same `ignored_arguments` reporting and the same rule that a
tool may not take the task down with it. Above it, nothing knows where it came
from: the registry stores it, the gate gates it, the executor calls it, and none
of them has a branch for it. A second tool system - an MCP registry, an MCP
executor - would be a second answer to a question this repository answered in
Phase 4.

Three things are decided here rather than by the server, and each is a rule from
ADR 0015 made structural:

**The effect is local.** It comes off the `Integration` record, not off the
tool's description of itself, and an unclassified tool is EXECUTE - which is
HIGH, which asks. The server does not get a vote on whether its own actions
need approval.

**The name is namespaced.** `gmail.send_message`, so two servers offering
`search` are two tools, an employee's declaration names one of them, and a
trace read months later says which service was reached.

**The result is framed as untrusted.** Whatever comes back is external content
on its way into a model's context, so it is wrapped before it leaves this
method. Doing it here rather than in the executor is what keeps the executor
free of the branch, and it means a tool cannot forget.
