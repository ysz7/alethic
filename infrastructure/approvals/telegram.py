"""Asking a person who is not at the keyboard.

The local interface parks a question on a browser tab. That is the right answer
while somebody has the tab open, and no answer at all for the case this exists
for: a run that starts while the user is somewhere else and reaches something
irreversible ten minutes in. The choice then is between refusing the action and
reaching the person where they actually are.

It is one file and no new dependency - Telegram's bot API is HTTP and `httpx` is
already here - and it is wired only when a token is configured. The platform
does not gain a chat integration by being installed.

Three decisions worth stating:

**The message is the redacted request, and no more.** What is sent leaves the
machine and lands in somebody's chat history, on their phone, synced to
Telegram's servers. `ApprovalRequest.redacted()` is applied before anything is
formatted, and the payload is trimmed rather than dumped.

**Anything but a pressed Approve is a no.** A timeout, a network failure, a
malformed update, a reply from a chat that was not the one asked - all of them
answer the same way the closed browser tab does.

**The deadline is the point, not a safety net.** Nobody is watching a chat the
way they watch a prompt they just triggered, so a question here expires by
default and the run continues as refused rather than parking forever.
