"""Which workspace this process is in, and where that workspace's files are.

Three decisions are worth the words.

**The active workspace is a file, not a row.** `alethic workspace use work`
writes it and every later process reads it, exactly as the stop signal works and
for the same reason: it is a fact about this machine rather than about the data,
and a database that is moved to another machine should not bring "which
workspace that other machine was looking at" with it. An unreadable or unknown
value falls back to the default workspace, because refusing to start over a
one-line file would be a worse failure than working in the wrong one.

**A run carries its own workspace.** `enter` sets a context variable, so a task
started in `work` keeps reading `work`'s files even if the person switches while
it runs, and two tasks running at once in different workspaces resolve the same
relative path to different files. An `asyncio` task copies the context at
creation, which is what makes that true without anybody passing it down.

**Roots are declared, not queried.** The filesystem tools ask for the current
root on every call, and a call cannot wait on a database read; so the
application hands the known workspaces in whenever they change, the same way it
refreshes integration grants. A workspace nobody declared gets the derived
path anyway rather than an error - the map is a cache of names, not the
authority on whether the directory may exist.
