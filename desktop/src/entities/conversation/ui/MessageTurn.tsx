/**
 * One turn of the conversation: what was asked, and what came back.

 * Either the answer or the fact that work is still happening. What is *missing*
 * from a finished answer is shown rather than hidden: a run that did most of a
 * job and says so is more useful than one that reports success, and Phase 11
 * found the second failure mode is the expensive one.
 *
 * What the work looked like arrives through `work` rather than being drawn
 * here, because the trail is another entity's and one slice does not reach into
 * another. This one only decides where it goes: open while the turn runs, folded
 * behind "Worked for" once it has an answer.
