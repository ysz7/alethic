/**
 * The only file in this application that knows how the runtime is reached.
 *
 * Everything above `shared` calls methods; nothing above it builds a URL, opens
 * an `EventSource` or knows the transport is HTTP at all. That is what makes
 * the React code an interface rather than a client library with a view attached
 * - and what would make moving to Tauri IPC, or to a remote engine later, a
 * change to one file on one layer.
 *
 * What it deliberately does not do matters as much. It never decides whether an
 * action is allowed, never chooses an employee, never retries work and never
 * interprets a result. Those belong to the core, and a convenience here that
 * guessed at any of them would be a second, disagreeing copy of a rule the
 * platform already enforces.
