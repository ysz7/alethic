 * The application: one provider, a sidebar, a page, and which workspace they
 * are of.
 *
 * The app layer holds state and no rules: which page is shown, which thread is
 * open (none is a new task), whether the sidebar is out, and two counters - one
 * that changes when the workspace does and one that changes when the page did
 * something the sidebar should show at once. The first remounts everything,
 * because the thread, the history and the documents all belong to a workspace,
 * and a screen left over from the previous one would be showing another
 * context's work under the new context's name.
 *
 * Settings take the whole window and bring their own menu. A list of threads
 * beside a screen that has nothing to do with any of them is a column of dead
 * weight, and the way back is one button that says so.
