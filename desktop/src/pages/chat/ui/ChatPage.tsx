/**
 * One screen: a conversation with Prometheus, and what it is doing about it.
 *
 * Not a dashboard. It shows the thing the person came to do - say what they
 * need - and shows the work only while there is work. The column is narrow and
 * the composer floats over its foot, so the request is always the nearest thing
 * to the person's hands.
 *
 * Until something has been asked there is no foot to float over: an empty
 * thread puts the greeting and the field in the middle of the window, which is
 * where the eye already is and where the one action on the screen belongs. The
 * composer docks the moment there is a conversation to keep above it.
 *
 * Called `chat` since Phase 15, when the word "workspace" stopped meaning three
 * things at once. It is the conversation; a workspace is the context the
 * conversation happens in, named in the header and chosen under the field.
