/**
 * The page's state, and the only place that holds any.
 *
 * Thin on purpose: the thread on screen, what each run in it was seen doing,
 * the questions waiting on the person, and who is available. Every one of those
 * is *read* from the runtime rather than derived here - there is no local model
 * of a task's lifecycle, no optimistic status and no rule about when work is
 * finished. The runtime says; this remembers what it last said.
 *
 * Which thread is on screen is the frame's to say (`conversationId`), because
 * the sidebar lists them. A new task has none until its first request: a thread
 * is opened when there is something to put in it, not when a window starts -
 * the version that opened one per start filled the list with blank rows.
