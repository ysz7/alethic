/**
 * Settings: one screen per thing, and a menu down the side.
 *
 * Deliberately not an administration console. Everything else configurable is a
 * file on this machine that the runtime already reads, and a screen that
 * mirrored those files would be a second place to change them - the one that
 * goes stale. What is here is what has no file: a workspace, a document
 * somebody brought, what the platform has remembered, the models it may reach
 * and the plugins it can act through.
 *
 * It used to be all five of those in one column, every form standing open,
 * navigated by jump links. That is a document, not a settings screen: the thing
 * a person came to change was always somewhere below the thing they did not.
 * One section is shown at a time and each one asks for its own state, so the
 * screen also stops reading five parts of the runtime to show one.
