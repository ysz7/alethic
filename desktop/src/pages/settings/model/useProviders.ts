/**
 * The settings screen's provider state: what is connected, and nothing derived.
 *
 * Every operation ends by re-reading the runtime's answer rather than patching
 * a local copy. Whether a connection can be removed, which model a kind of work
 * reaches, whether a key is stored - all of those are the core's answers, and a
 * local guess would be a second copy of a rule that disagrees the first time
 * the real one changes.
