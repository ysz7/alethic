//! Starting the local Alethic runtime, and getting out of its way.
//!
//! The shell is an interface. It does not plan, does not call a model, does not
//! touch the database and does not know what an employee is - it owns a window
//! and, on this machine, the lifetime of the process behind it. Everything the
//! window shows arrives over the same local HTTP the browser page uses, which
//! is what keeps the two views of one engine rather than two engines.
//!
//! Three decisions are worth stating.
//!
//! **A runtime that is already up is used, never replaced.** A developer with
//! `alethic serve` running in a terminal opens this and gets that engine, with
//! its database and its running work. Starting a second one against the same
//! SQLite file would be two writers and one file.
//!
//! **The child is killed when the window closes**, but only if this process
//! started it. Killing an engine somebody else launched would take their
//! running work down with a window they merely closed.
//!
//! **The command is configurable and defaults to the repository.** A packaged
//! application will point `ALETHIC_RUNTIME_CMD` at an installed interpreter;
//! during development the default is what a developer already has working.
