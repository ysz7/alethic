"""Phase 13's Definition of Done: a conversation, through the boundary a shell uses.

The desktop window talks HTTP and server-sent events to the local runtime, so
this exercises exactly that: the FastAPI adapter, the application-level
boundary, the manager, the employee runtime, the approval gate and SQLite on a
temporary file. One thing is scripted - the model - because the suite runs
without a provider key.

What is being proved is not "the endpoints answer". It is that the interface
layer decides nothing: the same sentence produces the same work whatever it says
about where it came from, the answer a window shows is the one the store holds,
and an irreversible action still waits for a person who is not on the call stack
that asked.
