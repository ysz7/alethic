"""Adding a provider through the surface a person actually uses.

The whole of Phase 17 as one test file: a key typed into the settings page ends
up encrypted in the store, a model added afterwards can name the connection it
is reached through, and a kind of work can be sent to that model - through HTTP,
against the real application, with nothing mocked below the transport.

The rule with the most teeth here is the negative one: **no response ever
carries a key**. It is asserted on every body that comes back rather than on
one, because a settings page leaks a credential exactly once.
