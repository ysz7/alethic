"""Phase 12's Definition of Done: three people, one objective, parallel branches.

*A goal requiring three employees is completed, with parallel branches; the
memory isolation test is green.*

Written the way Phase 8's is - against the employees that actually ship, read
off `employees/`, with nothing declared inside the test. What is faked is the
models and the runtime, because the claim under test is about the manager's
decomposition, its execution and what each employee is allowed to know - not
about whether a browser opened.
