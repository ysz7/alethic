"""Phase 11's Definition of Done, as a test that adds a scenario and runs it.

*There is a written answer to the question of what Prometheus does reliably, what it
does sometimes, and what it does not do at all.* The answer is only worth
anything if producing it takes no code - so this declares a scenario in a
temporary directory, runs it through the harness, and reads the answer back out.
If any of that ever needs a line of Python somewhere else, the claim is broken
and this is where it shows.

The employee here does not exist and the model is never called. That is
deliberate: what is under test is the harness's honesty - that it reads the
world rather than the run's own account of itself - and a real model would
make every assertion about a model instead.
