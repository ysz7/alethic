"""Memory on a real SQLite file, with the real index behind it.

The unit tests run against the in-memory store, which shares the domain's
ranking and access rules but not its search. What is checked here is the half
that is SQLite's: that FTS5 exists where the migration says it does, that the
triggers keep it in step with the table, and that prose full of punctuation is a
query rather than a syntax error.
