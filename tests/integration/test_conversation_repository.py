"""Threads, and the objectives that are their messages, on a real SQLite file.

The property being checked is the one that made this schema worth having: a
conversation stores no messages, so reading a thread reads the objectives - and
what a window shows cannot drift from the record of the work. A `messages`
table would have had to be kept in step with `objectives`, and the copy an
interface read would have been the one that went stale.
