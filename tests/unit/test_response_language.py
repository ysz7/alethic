"""The user is answered in the language they were promised.

`PROMETHEUS_RESPONSE_LANGUAGE` existed from Phase 2 and reached exactly one CLI
command. Everything a person reads through the manager - the reply to a request
that needs no work, and the answer at the end of one that did - ignored it, so a
request typed in Russian came back in English. A window makes that a bug you
cannot look away from, which is how Phase 13 found it.

What is checked here is the instruction, not the model's obedience: whether the
sentence was sent is ours, whether it was followed is the model's.
