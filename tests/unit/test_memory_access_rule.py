"""The rule that makes the memory backend replaceable (§9.9, §9.10).

Every search goes through `Memory.recall`. Nothing above `infrastructure/`
mentions the table, the index or the query language - so replacing FTS5 with a
vector store is replacing one adapter, and not half the codebase.

Checked as a property of the source, because the failure it prevents is not one
any run would fail on: a `MATCH` written into the runtime works perfectly until
the day the store changes.
