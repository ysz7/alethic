No FastAPI, no browser, no window. What is being checked is the part a second
interface would otherwise have to write for itself: that a request is carried in
whatever it says about its origin, that a thread is a view of objectives rather
than a second record of them, that unknown means "no such thing" rather than a
crash, and that answering an approval is carrying a decision rather than making
one.
