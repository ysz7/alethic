"""Turning "this employee may use Gmail" into names a registry can enforce.

A grant is declared per integration and enforced per tool, and this is the one
place the two meet. `ToolRegistry` already refuses a tool an actor was not
granted, by name, before a call is built - so rather than teaching it a second
kind of permission, the integration's current tool names are added to the
employee's `allowed_tools` and least privilege stays exactly where it was.

Three properties are the reason it is written as a function over values rather
than as a lookup somewhere:

**It can only add.** An employee's own `allowed_tools` is never reduced here,
and a grant contributes only names belonging to an integration that employee
named. Nothing in this module can widen anything the user did not write down.

**A disabled or unusable integration contributes nothing.** Not an error - the
declaration is still right, the service is merely switched off - and the
employee simply cannot see those tools until it is switched back on.

**A grant nobody can satisfy is silence, not a failure.** An employee naming an
integration this machine has never had loads and runs; it is reported by
`domain.employees.validation` as a warning, for the same reason a missing tool
is: the declaration may be right and the machine merely configured differently.
