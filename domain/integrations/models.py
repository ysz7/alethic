"""An external service the user connected, and what the platform makes of it.

Every capability before this one was written here: a tool is a file, its author
declares an `Effect`, and ADR 0010 turns that declaration into a risk level
nobody can lower. An integration breaks that assumption in one place - the tools
arrive at runtime, from a process this platform did not write, describing
themselves - and the two values on this record are what put it back.

`effects` is the local answer to "what does this tool do to the world". It is
written on this machine and it is the only thing the policy layer reads. A
server's own description of its tools may be *proposed* to a person and may
never become the stored value on its own: the party whose actions are being
classified is not the party that classifies them (ADR 0015, §24).

`granted_capabilities` is the local answer to "what work can reach this". It is
what an employee holding this integration adds to its own capabilities, so the
manager can route by it - an ability nobody declared is work that never arrives.

Both are data on a record rather than something derived from the server, and
that is the whole of the trust boundary.
