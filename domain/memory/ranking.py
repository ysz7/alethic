"""What is worth recalling, and what has stopped being worth it.

Two policies live here, and both are the domain's rather than a backend's:
recency and importance decide the order results come back in, and a kind of
memory decides how long an item is kept at all. A backend that ranked by its
own index alone would return whatever matched best, which for memory is the
wrong question - the best match to "the report" is every report ever written.

The formula is deliberately plain: score = relevance * importance * decay(age),
with a half-life per kind. Working notes are worth little by tomorrow; something
learned about how the user wants things done is worth as much next month. A
model is not asked to rank, because ranking is called on every recall and a call
per recall would make remembering more expensive than working.
