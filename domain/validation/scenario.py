"""A real task, written down so the same request can be made twice.

The validation tasks under `validation/` were prose until now: what was asked,
what came back, what broke. Prose is the right form for the reasoning and the
wrong form for the request - a sentence in a report cannot be re-run, and a
capability that worked in July is only known to still work if the July request
can be made again in September (§11.5).

So a scenario is a declaration, discovered the way an employee or a workflow is,
and it states three things and no more:

* **what is asked**, in one of the three ways this platform can be asked - a
  goal for Prometheus, a goal for a named employee, or a workflow by name. There is
  deliberately no fourth: a scenario that needed its own way of running work
  would be measuring something the user cannot do.
* **what the machine must have** for the request to mean anything. A scenario
  that drives a screen says so, and is skipped rather than failed where the
  desktop is switched off. A suite that fails on a correctly configured machine
  teaches people to ignore it.
* **what would count as done** - the same discipline Prometheus applies to an
  objective, applied to the scenario: written before the run, so the standard
  cannot be adjusted after seeing the output.

What a scenario does *not* carry is a way to fix the world it needs. `reset`
removes paths inside the workspace and `setup` writes files into it, and that is
the whole of it. Anything more - a fixture process, a stubbed provider - would
make the run a test again, and the point of the phase is that it is not one.
