"""What one run left behind, and whether it is what was asked for.

Gathered by whoever ran the scenario and then read by pure functions, for the
reason the policy engine is a pure function: a verdict that depends on a clock,
a file handle or a live database decides differently on Tuesday, and a record of
what the platform can do is worth nothing if it is not comparable across runs.

The counters are not a second accounting system. Every one of them is read back
out of what the platform already writes down - the task rows, `tool_calls`, the
audit log - and assembling them here is what turns three stores into one line a
person can compare with last week's.
