"""How a scenario reaches the platform - and the reason there are exactly three.

A scenario is a request a user could have made, so it runs the way a user's
request runs: through the manager, through a named employee, or through a
declared workflow. Those are the platform's three doors and this file names all
of them as contracts, so the harness holds no way to run work that a person does
not also have. A fourth contract here would be a fourth way to do the work, and
what the suite then measured would be itself.

`StepExecution` is deliberately reused rather than restated: the workflow engine
already asks for exactly this, the task runner already satisfies it, and a
second protocol with the same signature would be two names for one idea.
