"""The engine itself: named rules, and the order they are applied in.

Two kinds of rule meet here and they are not interchangeable.

The **threshold** applies to everybody and comes from the risk table alone: at
HIGH and above a person decides. It is the floor, and no declaration removes it
- an employee cannot opt out of being asked about.

A **named policy** is what one employee's declaration opted *into*, and it can
only narrow. `read_only` denies what the threshold would have allowed;
nothing in this catalog widens anything, because a declaration that could grant
itself more than the platform's default would make the default meaningless.

Rules are ordered by severity, not by declaration order: DENY beats
REQUIRE_APPROVAL beats ALLOW whichever policy produced it. Otherwise two
policies on one employee would resolve by the accident of how the YAML was
typed, and a reviewer would have to read the file in order to know what it does.
