"""A conversation is a thread of requests, and nothing more.

The temptation here is a second lifecycle: messages, roles, a state machine, a
place for an assistant to store what it said. That would be a parallel history
of the same work, and the two would disagree the first time a run was resumed
or a process was killed mid-answer.

So a conversation holds no messages. **One user message is one objective** -
already recorded, already carrying the user's verbatim words, the criteria read
out of them, the plan, the tasks and the answer. This type exists to give those
objectives an order and a name; the messages are read back by asking the
objective repository which objectives belong to the thread.

The consequence worth stating: a conversation cannot drift from what actually
happened, because it stores nothing that could drift.
