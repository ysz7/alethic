"""A connection to a provider: which kind, reached how, paying with what.

**A provider is a kind; a connection is an account.** The kind is something the
platform knows how to talk to; what a user adds is a way in - a name they chose,
the kind it is, optionally an address, and the name of the credential it pays
with. That distinction is the whole reason this type exists: one person can hold
two keys to one vendor - work and personal, or a client's and their own - and a
record keyed by vendor cannot say that.

**`kind` is a plain string here, and that is not laziness.** No vendor is named
anywhere under `domain/` (ADR 0003), and `tests/unit/test_architecture_boundaries.py`
fails the build over it - so which kinds exist is decided where the adapters
are, in `infrastructure/llm/`, exactly as `ModelChoice.provider` has always been
a string. A closed enum here would have put five product names in the one layer
that must not know any.

**The credential is named here and never held here.** Same asymmetry as an
integration record (ADR 0015) and for a stronger reason: this row is read to
build a client on a hot path, and a value that appears in a row appears in every
log line, error and debugger frame that ever prints one. `secret_name` points at
the credential store; the value is resolved at the moment of the call.

`base_url` empty means the adapter's own default, which is what almost every
connection wants. It is here for the two cases that are real: a model runner on
another port, and a gateway that speaks a kind's protocol at its own address.
