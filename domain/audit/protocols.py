"""What was done here, by whom, and what came of it.

Writing and reading are two protocols rather than one, for the same reason
`Memory` and `MemoryMaintenance` are separate: the executor needs to append and
must never be able to read the whole history back, and holding the appender is
not an argument for holding the reader.

`result` is a string rather than an enum because an audit line is a record of
what happened, and the three values it takes today - SUCCESS, FAILURE, DENIED -
are the schema's business. Widening the vocabulary must not mean a domain change
that every existing row has to be migrated for.
