"""Work that starts without anybody asking for it (§12.9).

Everything the platform has done so far began with a sentence somebody typed.
This is the first thing that does not, and that changes what has to be written
down rather than what has to be built: a run nobody is watching needs a record
of *why it started* that a person can read afterwards, because there is no
conversation above it to explain itself.

Two triggers, one shape. A `Schedule` says what to ask for and when: either
every so often, or when something of a named kind happens. Both produce the
same thing - an objective, handed to the same manager, through the same doors -
because a second way to start work would be the same design error as a second
employee runtime.

**Time here is UTC and explicit.** A local-time schedule is a promise about a
machine that travels, changes clocks twice a year, and is asleep for some of
it. UTC and a stated offset is a promise about a moment.

**A missed run is not made up.** A machine that was off for a day does not owe
an hourly schedule twenty-four objectives; it owes one, now. Catching up is a
decision, and this is the decision: the point of "every hour" is that the work
is current, and twenty-four stale runs are worse than one fresh one - louder,
more expensive, and each of them wrong about a world that has moved.

**Nothing here bypasses anything.** A scheduled objective meets the same
policies, the same approval gate and the same STOP file as one a person asked
for. That is deliberate and is not a limitation to be worked around later: an
action nobody is present to approve is exactly the action that most needs
somebody present.
