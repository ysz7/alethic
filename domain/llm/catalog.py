"""What one model is: what it can do, what it costs, how it is reached.

A value, not a file. The *loading* of a catalog is infrastructure - TOML on
disk, rows in a store - and lives there; what an entry is has to be here,
because the application layer administers these and may not import
infrastructure (ADR 0001).

No vendor is named. `provider` and `model` are strings the adapters interpret,
exactly as `ModelChoice` has always carried them, and `connection` is the name
of a record somebody added.
