"""How a lexical hit and a semantic hit are compared with each other.

The problem is that they are not the same number. A text index answers with a
rank whose scale is its own; a vector store answers with a similarity. Neither
means anything to the other, and taking the larger of the two would mean
whichever index happened to be more generous always won.

So both are normalised to a fraction of the best hit *of their own kind* before
this sees them - the rule Phase 9 already applies to FTS5 rank - and this blends
what is left. A passage found by both is worth more than a passage found by one,
which is the whole reason for running two searches, and the weights say which
half is trusted more when they disagree.

Deliberately not a model call. Ranking happens on every retrieval, and a call
per retrieval would make reading a document more expensive than working with it
- the same reasoning that keeps `domain/memory/ranking.py` an arithmetic
expression.
