"""Knowledge: what the user brought, as values.

A document is not a memory (ADR 0016). Memory decays, expires and is recalled
hedged - "you noted last time"; a document was put here on purpose, does not
get less true in March than it was in January, and is *quoted* with a source
rather than remembered. So it has its own values, its own store and its own
contract, and the two meet in the context assembler and nowhere else.

Two fields exist because of the failure they prevent.

`embedding_model` and `embedding_dimension` are on every chunk. Without them,
changing the embedding model - or moving to another store - leaves nobody able
to say whether the vectors already written are comparable with the ones a query
produces, and the answer becomes a guess. With them, a mismatch means
re-indexing, which is work; without them, it means silently comparing numbers
that mean different things, which is a wrong answer nobody can see.

`checksum` is what makes adding the same file twice an update rather than a
second copy of it. A person who fixed a typo and re-added the file wants the
corrected text searched, not both versions of it.
